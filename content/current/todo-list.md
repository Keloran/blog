# Another project
So I decided to create another project, this was mainly to re-learn react, and to get back into the swing of things, so what is it

Well if you can't guess by the title, its a todo-list, specifically [Todo-List.app](https://todo-list.app)

### Features
- Entirly private, encryption happens in browser
- Storage is only of the encrypted form
- Login is using Keycloak, so no "real" details are retained
- Export/Import todo.txt

#### Unfinished features
- Project support (its a very simple todo, only items and sub-items atm)
