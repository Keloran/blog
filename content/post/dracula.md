# Dracula Theme
Well I have officially been made one of the maintainers of the Dracula theme, specificlly the HyprLand, Sway Notification Center, and Waybar, also at time of writing being considered for SwayLock

## How did this Happen
Chance, I create a couple of PRs for Dracula-UI, and made the official Textarea part, because of this I have been on the discord for a while, then a member noticed that the old maintainer had deleted their Github account,

which meant that the maintainer no-longer existed, Lucas asked and I said I would take over them
