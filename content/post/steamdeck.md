# SteamDeck woes
Here is my timeline, I ordered the steamdeck very quickly after announcement 256Gb

- Reserved - 16th July 2021
- Email and Paid - 25th July 2022
- Shipping - 29th July 2022
- Arrived - 3rd August 2022
- Steam Deck died - 28th August 2022 (it never had a fan that was below 7k RPM, so my guess is it overheated)
- Steam Support contacted -30th August 2022 (there were 4 seperate methods to see if it could be reset and work)
- RMA initiated - 8th September 2022
- Steam Deck Sent back - 12th September 2022 (needed to confirm it was replacement not refund)
- Steam Deck Replacement Shipping Email - 20th September 2022
- Steam Deck Replacement Arrived - 24th September 2022
- Fails to boot, does "steamdeck login (tty)" - 2nd July 2023
- Support contacted - 4th July
- RMA initiated - 5th July

So I've had 2 steamdecks and not quite been 1 year since my original arrived, and ill be on my 3rd soon
